        <p class="py-6">I am a first year student at the University of Ottawa that has always been interested in technology. I started programming in the 9th grade with game development and moved onto Java and Python where I developed a deep passion for coding.

            After continuing to learn for many years I participated in events such as the Waterloo Computing Contest, and the Engineering Idol, where I built a water filter for indigenous communities using Arduino.
